
Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of this project is gathering of data for an entire School District, such as funding and student grades, to learn new insights and visually provide clear results on each school's performance. Additionally, to uphold state-testing standards, In analysising the information a few times  the data was showing differently than what was expected. As a result, implications of omitting the potentially dishonest data are also discussed. by using the Pandas loc method with conditional statements and comparison and logical operators the ninth-grade reading and math scores for Thomas High School was used and then, Pandas was used in combination with NumPy module to change the reading and math scores to NaN.

Summary: Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.

When reviewing the School spending and size, removing the ninth grade scores did not affect the average math and reading scores, but it did affect the passing percentages for medium-sized schools (1,000-2,000). In this category, % passing math, % passing reading, and % overall passing dropped 6% each. Before everything changed with the data change, the School Size summary showed that medium-sized school had a high performance (91% overall passing) compared to small (90% overall passing) and large schools (58% overall passing). Given the data change, medium size school are the second in performing schools. 
In reviewing the last summary on School Types, this data change also affected the passing percentages that compared charter and district schools. Fortunately, it did not affect the average scores for these two school types. Removing the scores resulted in a reduction in charter school's passing percentages. Before the data change, charter schools had very high passing percentages: around 90% overall passing.
